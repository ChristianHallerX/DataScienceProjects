	- [Detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease](https://github.com/ChristianHallerX/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/Detecting_Parkinsons.ipynb): Classifying speech recordings of PD patients and healthy candidates.<br/>Libraries: XGBoost.

	- [House Sales and Price Prediction in King County (Seattle)](https://github.com/ChristianHallerX/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/House_Sales_and_Price_Prediction_King_County(Seattle).ipynb): The project explores different house sales features and regression modelling techniques for optimizing price prediction.<br/>Libraries: SciKit-Learn.
	
	- [Permeability Prediction from Thin Sections](https://github.com/ChristianHallerX/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/RockPermeabilityPrediction/Reservoir_Permeability_WatsonStudio.ipynb): Evaluation of various Machine Learning/Deep Learning using Cross Validation algorithms trained on reservoir-rock thin sections. Deployment on cloud for inference.<br/>Libraries: SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
	
	- [Sonar (chirp) Data Classification of Underwater Mines and Rocks](https://github.com/ChristianHallerX/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/Sonar_classification_NN_GridSearch.ipynb): Train neural networks on sonar data.
