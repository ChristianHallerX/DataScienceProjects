This folder contains various Data Science projects and some examples of Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques.

Note: Some were created on IBM Watson Studio in the Cloud, some were created in an Anaconda environment.

PS: In fact, IBM Watson Studio is also an Anaconda environment, they just don't tell you.
