## Contents

- Machine Learning

	- [Detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease](https://www.google.com): Classifying speech recordings of PD patients and healthy candidates. Libraries: XGBoost.

	- [Drowsiness Detection](https://www.google.com): Detect drowsiness in real-time video footage, such as a webcam feed. Libraries: OpenCV.

	- [House Sales and Price Prediction in King County (Seattle)](https://www.google.com): The project explores different house sales features and regression modelling techniques for optimizing price prediction. Libraries: SciKit-Learn.


- Natural Language Processing

	- [Three-Way Sentiment Analysis for Twitter Tweets](https://www.google.com): Twitter sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) classification model for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. Libraries: NLTK, SciKit-Learn.


- Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Exploring US Economic Data with a Dashboard](https://www.google.com): This project intents to visualize simple time-series data in a dashboard and makes it permanently available in an S3 bucket. Libraries: Bokeh.
	
	- [Toronto Neighborhoods Analysis](https://www.google.com): The project explores the Wikipedia data on Toronto (Canadia) neighbourhoods with the post code M and will create labelled, interactive maps. Libraries: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Folium.


- Deep Learning

	- [A simple model for Dogs vs. Cats Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN) Part I](https://www.google.com): A 2,000 images dataset of cat and dogs pictures from Kaggle trained for 2-category classification. Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras.
	
	- [A simple model for Dogs vs. Cats Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN) Part II](https://www.google.com): This project expands on Part I with transfer learning from publicly-available neural net Inception V3. Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras.
	
	- [Brent Crude Oil price prediction with LSTM](https://www.google.com): Price time-series modeling with LSTM and comparison of performance of Mean Absolute Error and Mean Square Error. Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras. 




This folder contains various Data Science projects and some examples of Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques.

Note: Some were created on IBM Watson Studio in the Cloud, some were created in an Anaconda environment.

PS: In fact, IBM Watson Studio is also an Anaconda environment, they just don't tell you.
