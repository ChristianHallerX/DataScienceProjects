AirBnB maintains and hosts an accomodation marketplace, accessible to consumers on its website. It has become an icon of the "sharing culture" where people bring their own private assets to market instead of seeking employment or starting a traditional business.
The AirBnB marketplace contains different categories of accomodations that can be booked from their owners directly unlike with traditional hotels.

Goal of this project is to wrangle the raw AirBnB listings for Berlin available for Summer 2020 and analyze their structure.
Key questions to be answered are:
1. How are the prices distributed?
2. Breakdown of listings by room type.
3. What is the median price of a listing by district and room type.
4. What is the average difference in a listing price between superhost and non-superhost status for each room type and district?
5. Train a price prediction model (regressor).
