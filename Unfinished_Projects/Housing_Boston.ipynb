    "### Feature Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "To dive a bit deeper int our data, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`. For each data point (neighborhood):\n",
    "- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor).\n",
    "- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without building a model, let's try to figure out if an increase in the value of a feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- **'RM':** An increase in the value of this feature will lead to an increase in the value of 'MEDV'. This is because for you'd expect a home with a higher number of rooms to be more expensive that a home with lower number of rooms. \n",
    "- **'LSTAT':** An increase in the value of this feature will lead to a decrease in the value of 'MEDV'. A lower status homeowner might not be able to afford costly housing, so you'd expect them to live in lower priced homes. A higher percentage of such people could correlate to cheaper homes in an area, and thus, a lower 'MEDV' value.\n",
    "- **'PTRATIO':** An increase in the value of this feature will lead to an decrease in the value of 'MEDV'. A low student to teacher ration is typically associated with better education level of a school, as a teacher is able to focus on individual students better (than if there were more students). So, due to the presence of better quality schools, people might be willing to pay more to live in those areas, to provide their children with better education, and the prices might be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can build regression plots to see if our intuition is correct."

This happens because with fewer training points, the model can modify its paramters to better approximate the targets; but as the number of training points increases, perfectly fitting them becomes more difficult, and the training score goes down. \n",
    "- The score of the training curve increases as more training points are added, but there's a slight dip after adding more than 350 training points. The score starts lower because the model has not yet learned enough to predict test points. As the model receives more training points, and hence, more information, it is better suited to predict unseen data.\n",

    "This finishes our project. We have built a decision tree regressor that performs reasonably well given the 3 features. But should the model should be used in a real-world setting? It probably shouldn't because: \n",

    "- The data collected in 1978 is not really relevant today due to rising population levels and changing population density of different areas. \n",
    "- The features present in the data that we built our model on are not likely be sufficient to describe a home. Examples of interesting features to look at may be *proximity to city center*, or *neighbourhood crime rate*.  \n",
    "- The data collected in an urban city will not be applicable in a rural city, because the people might value different aspects of a home depending on whether they live in an urban city or a rural area. For example, a person living in a rural city might value number of rooms in a home over the proximity to the city."
