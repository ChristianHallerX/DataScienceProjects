# Sedimentary Facies Machine Learning - XGBoost with Intelligent Bayesian Optimization

The Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG), Matt Hall (Agile), and Brendon Hall (Enthought) ran in 2016 a competition on who can create the best Machine Learning model in classifying sedimentary facies in several wells using wireline measurements. For the dataset provided, a subject-matter expert (e.g., sedimentologist) manually described core sections and gave the facies names, which is calles labeling. This complete dataset can be used to train a Machine Learning Model. Note that in Artificial Intelligence rules are not hard-coded as in traditional programming, rather we give the computer the inputs and outputs, and the let it figure out the rules. These rules can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen, data. In this case we can then use new wireline data to predict sedimentological facies.
